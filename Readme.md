# WinForms Scheduler - Enable the Gantt View

In this example, the Scheduler control is bound to a collection of [customÂ objects](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/9606/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/data-binding/data-sources/business-objects) and displays appointments in a Gantt View. The example also uses theÂ [Resources Tree](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/10685/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/visual-elements/resources-tree)Â to display a resource hierarchy.

### Implementation Details

To display appointments in a Gantt View, you should have three collections that implement theÂ `IBindingList`Â interface (we recommend you use `System.ComponentModel.BindingList<T>`):

* Appointments
* Resources
* Appointments dependencies.

Business objects should have specific properties forÂ [mapping](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/15468/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/data-binding/mappings) to the corresponding properties of Scheduler appointments, resources, and appointments dependencies.


> **Note**
>
> You can also use the [WinForms Gantt Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/401173/controls-and-libraries/gantt-control/gantt-control) designed to address your project planning requirements regardless of dataset size and information complexity..
